# README

This is based on [useapassphrase.com](https://www.useapassphrase.com) whose author has kindly made it available as open-source.

I removed the extra bits that weren't of use to me, and also made some changes to the code to better suit my frequent use cases.

# RUNNING THIS

Simply clone the repo or download a zip of it and extract to a folder. Serve that folder via any webserver. It doesn't need anything server side as this is simply a page with some Javascript to generate the passphrase and show it to you.
